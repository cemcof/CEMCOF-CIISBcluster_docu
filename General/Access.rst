Access
------

The access to the cluster is currently limited only to active users of the Cryo-electron microscopy and tomography core facility CEITEC MU. In order to access the cluster, the users first must have an active account in Metacentrum_ . Once an functional account is available, the new users shall send a separate email requesting access to the cluster.

The CEMCOF users with access to the storage **brno14-ceitec** (``storage-brno14-ceitec.metacentrum.cz``) do automatically have access to the computational resources of the cluster.

In order to log in, open a terminal and type
``<user>@ciisb.ceitec.muni.cz``
where ``<user>`` corresponds to your login in MetaCentrum.

Each user has 2GB quota in their ``/home/<user>`` directory.

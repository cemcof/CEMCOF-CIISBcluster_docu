FigTree
---------

**VERSIONS:**

* 1.4.4_220330

**GENERAL INFORMATION**

FigTree is designed as a graphical viewer of phylogenetic trees and as a program for producing publication-ready figures. 
As with most of my programs, it was written for my own needs so may not be as polished 
and feature-complete as a commercial program. In particular it is designed to display 
summarized and annotated trees produced by BEAST.

**USAGE SPECIFIC INFORMATION**

.. code-block:: console

   $ ssh ciisb.ceitec.muni.cz
   $ module add figtree
   $ figtree
   
* Version 1.4.4 was released in 2018. Code from master branch was thus used instead, because it has been developed further without
an official release.
